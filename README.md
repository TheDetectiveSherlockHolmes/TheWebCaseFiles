# 🕸 Web Development Projects

A collection of my frontend projects, assignments, and practice work.  
Each project is cleanly organized with its own folder, notes, and structure.

## 🔎 Structure
- Every project has:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js` (if required)
  - A `README.md` with logic, design notes, and screenshots

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub  
- Linux terminal workflow

## 🧠 Approach
Building frontend projects with clarity, minimalism, and structured execution —  
following a Sherlock-style workflow of observation → planning → clean implementation.
